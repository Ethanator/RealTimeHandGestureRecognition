\section{Segmentation}
By the time of my last report, I had not achieved real-time segmentation. Now, that part is completed and Figure \ref{fig:seg} shows how it works.

\section{Geometric Features}
I try to tease out the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Area and perimeter
\item Height and width
\item Mass center
\item Compactness
\item Normalized compactness
\item Major and minor axes lengths
\item Orientation
\item Eccentricity
\item Hu moments
\end{itemize}
I am able to compute all the features except compactness, normalized compactness, and Hu moments. I had trouble extracting the raw data from the area and perimeter variables which are 0x1 struct arrays, and that is why I cannot calculate the former two. As for Hu moments, the computation is tedious.
